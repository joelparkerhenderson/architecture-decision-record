# ADR template by Michael Nygard

This is the template in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
You can use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing the ADR files.

In each ADR file, write these sections:

# TITLE <short present tense imperative phrase, less than 50 characters, like a git commit message.>

## Status

<proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.>

## Context

<what is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change.>

## Decision

<what is the change that we're actually proposing or doing.>

## Consequences

<what becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change.>

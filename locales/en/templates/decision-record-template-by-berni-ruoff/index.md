# Decision record template by Berni Ruoff

This template was created by Berni Ruoff. A designer who is pursuing his dream of one day becoming one with business and technology.
This template helps to structure highly complex consequences and make them easier to digest using a RAID protocol.

Use those sections to create your own decision record:

# Title of your decission

## Status

Status of the proposal, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.

## Context

What is the motivation and context for our decision…

## Decision

What is our proposal to address it…

## Consequences / RAID

Describe either the consquences or the RAID (Risk, Assumption, Issue or Dependency) of your decision.

- **Risks** are events that may occur and that could have a negative impact on your project.
- **Assumptions** are anything that is believed to be true without empirical evidence or proof.
- **Issues** are problems that need to be resolved in order not to compromise the project.
- **Dependencies** describe related tasks or decisions that need to be completed in order to start or complete this task.

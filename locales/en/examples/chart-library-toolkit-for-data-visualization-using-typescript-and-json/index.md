Chart, Area Chart with Time Axis, Candlestick Chart, Nightingale Chart, Geo SVG Map. 3. Free open source.

Low importance: 1. Runtime speed. 2. Scalability. 3. Backwards compatibility.

-->

**Primary Objective:**  
To select an advanced charting toolkit for creating interactive visualizations, focusing on financial data, scientific data, and government data using TypeScript and JSON. The library should provide robust features, flexibility, and be open-source. 

### Context and Requirements:

1. **Agile Development (High Priority)**: As a startup, quick iteration, prototyping, and flexibility in development are essential. The chart library must allow for fast development cycles.
   
2. **Chart Types (High Priority)**:
   - **Doughnut Chart**
   - **Radar Chart**
   - **Clustering Process Chart**
   - **Area Chart with Time Axis**
   - **Candlestick Chart**
   - **Nightingale Chart**
   - **Geo SVG Map**
   
   These chart types are specifically important for visualizing complex datasets, such as financial trends, scientific metrics, and geographical information.

3. **Free and Open Source (High Priority)**: The toolkit should be open-source to avoid licensing costs, provide transparency, and offer flexibility for customization.

4. **Low Importance Criteria**:
   - **Runtime Speed**: While performance is important, it is not a top priority for this decision.
   - **Scalability**: Although scalability is generally important, the immediate need is to build an MVP that may grow over time. Scalability concerns can be addressed later.
   - **Backwards Compatibility**: Not a primary concern for the initial build, as long as the library is modern and actively maintained.

### 2. **Chart.js**

**Overview**:  
Chart.js is a simple, easy-to-use charting library for building common chart types. It’s known for its simplicity and ease of integration.

**Strengths**:
- **Ease of Use**: Chart.js is very simple to set up and use, with a minimal learning curve.
- **Open Source**: Chart.js is free and open-source, which is critical for reducing costs.
- **Common Chart Types**: It supports basic charts like doughnut, area, radar, and line charts, which cover most of the primary needs.

**Weaknesses**:
- **Limited Advanced Charts**: Chart.js does not natively support complex chart types like candlestick charts, geo SVG maps, or clustering process charts. While these features can be added through plugins or customization, it is not as straightforward as with other libraries.
- **Interactivity**: Although Chart.js supports basic interactivity (e.g., tooltips and hover effects), it does not offer as advanced features as ECharts or D3.js.

**Verdict**:  
Chart.js is great for simple, quick projects, but its lack of support for complex chart types makes it unsuitable for a data-heavy application with advanced needs like candlestick charts and geo maps. It’s a good choice for prototyping, but for the required chart types, more advanced tools are recommended.

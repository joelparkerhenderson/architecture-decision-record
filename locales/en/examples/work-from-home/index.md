# Decision record for work from home

Title: Employees can work from home

Decision Maker: Management Team

Decision Date: July 1, 2021

## Background

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many employees have been working remotely from home. This arrangement has provided benefits such as increased flexibility, improved work-life balance and a decrease in the spread of the virus. Furthermore, numerous employees have expressed that they would like to continue working from home even after the pandemic has ended.

## Decision

After weighing the pros and cons of allowing employees to work from home, the management team has decided to implement a permanent work from home policy for eligible employees. The policy applies to all full-time employees who can effectively perform their duties from home and have demonstrated success working remotely during the pandemic.

Eligible employees can choose to work from home up to three days per week, while in-office work will be required for the remaining two days. To ensure effective communication and collaboration, regular check-ins with team members and managers will be required. Additionally, employees will be provided with the necessary equipment and resources to perform their duties effectively from home.

The implementation of this policy will be reviewed and revisited regularly to ensure that it continues to benefit both the employees and the company.

## Reasoning

The decision to continue allowing employees to work from home is based on several factors, including employee work-life balance, greater flexibility and freedom, improved productivity, and less exposure to the risk of infection. By implementing a flexible work model, the company can attract and retain top talent while also providing a positive company culture.

## Implications

The implementation of the permanent work from home policy will have several implications, including the need for ongoing communication and coordination among team members, adjusting work processes and protocols to accommodate a remote workforce, and ensuring that all employees have access to the necessary equipment, tools and resources.

## Conclusion

The decision to implement a permanent work from home policy is in line with the company's values of promoting a healthy work-life balance, supporting employee well-being and promoting a positive company culture. We believe that this decision will enable our organization to be more agile and better suited to adapt to changing business needs while improving employee satisfaction and productivity.

## Decision

### Recommended Option: **SvelteUI**

- **Rationale**: SvelteUI offers a well-rounded, comprehensive suite of components that cater to the need for tables, charts, grids, and forms. It’s highly customizable, integrates well with other charting libraries (like `chart.js` and `d3.js`), and has a good balance of lightweight performance and feature richness. While it may not provide out-of-the-box Gantt chart support, it can be easily extended with third-party integrations, making it ideal for a full-featured, scalable solution.
  
  - **Pros**:
    - Excellent table and chart support.
    - Full grid and layout components.
    - Customizable and integrates well with external charting libraries.
    - Good community and documentation.
  
  - **Cons**:
    - Heavier than some other minimalist libraries.
    - Needs external integration for complex charts like Gantt charts.
  
### Alternative: **Flowbite** or **Carbon** (for larger enterprise projects)
- If a polished, Tailwind-based, or more consistent design system is required, **Flowbite** (with Tailwind CSS) or **Carbon** (for enterprise-grade solutions) may be suitable alternatives. However, they may require extra effort for integrations with more complex charts and components.

## Conclusion

The best fit for your requirements (full features for tables, charts, lists, grids, Gantt) is **SvelteUI**, followed by **Flowbite** and **Carbon** depending on the project needs and design preferences.

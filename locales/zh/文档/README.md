## What is an architecture decision record?

An **architecture decision record** (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

An **architecture decision** (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

An **architecture decision log** (ADL) is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization).

An **architecturally-significant requirement** (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture.

All these are within the topic of **architecture knowledge management** (AKM).

The goal of this document is to provide a fast overview of ADRs, how to create them, and where to look for more information.

Abbreviations:

  * **AD**: architecture decision

  * **ADL**: architecture decision log

  * **ADR**: architecture decision record

  * **AKM**: architecture knowledge management

  * **ASR**: architecturally-significant requirement

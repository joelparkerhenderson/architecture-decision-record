# 如何开始使用 ADR

要开始使用 ADR，请与团队成员讨论以下内容。

决策识别：

  * AD 的紧急程度和重要性如何？

  * 必须现在就做，还是可以等到了解更多信息后再做？

  * 个人和集体经验以及公认的设计方法和实践都可以帮助做出决策。

  * 理想情况下，应维护一份与产品待办事项清单相对应的决策待办事项清单。

做出决策：

  * A number of decision making techniques exists, both general ones and software architecture specific ones, for instance, dialogue mapping.

  * Group decision making is an active research topic.

决定的制定和执行：

  * ADs are used in software design; hence they have to be communicated to, and accepted by, the stakeholders of the system that fund, develop, and operate it.

  * Architecturally evident coding styles and code reviews that focus on architectural concerns and decisions are two related practices.

  * ADs also have to be (re-)considered when modernizing a software system in software evolution.

决策共享（可选）：

  * Many ADs recur across projects.

  * Hence, experiences with past decisions, both good and bad, can be valuable reusable assets when employing an explicit knowledge management strategy.

决策文件：

  * Many templates and tools for decision capturing exist.

  * See agile communities, e.g. M. Nygard's ADRs.

  * See traditional software engineering and architecture design processes, e.g. table layouts suggested by IBM UMF and by Tyree and Akerman from CapitalOne.
